# Python-Matrix-Calculator
Coded with ‚ù§ for my linalg class. Have fun!
To run:

You can run this easily on [Repl.it](https://replit.com/@RedFlame2112/MatrixCalcRepl#matrix.py)
First, go to the shell tab on the new repl and install ```$ pip install sympy``` in order to utilize the eigenvalue/vector capabilities for this calculator.

Afterwards, just clik run and you are all set :)
You may also run this on an IDE within your local computer if you have the capability to do so. Just make sure you also have the sympy library in your computer!
